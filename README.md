# Personal Portfolio
## Introdction
In this repository I reflect on my personal learning goals for the course Data Science for Smart Environments. I will start by summarizing the learning goals that I set at the start of this course. For each learning goal I will then show how I worked on this goal during the group project as well as outside the project if that was suitable. For each learning goal I will reflect on the methodology and data sources, implementation, results and conclusions.

## Original Learning Goals
1. Visualization: For this learning goal I wanted to implement a new visualization technique in the group project. An idea about the type of visualization was to make a heatmap using the python Folium package or arcGIS.
2. Time management: For this goal I wanted to keep track of time in our project by making a weekly planning and setting clear and concrete goals.
3. Statistical data analysis: For this goal I wanted to learn more about data analysis and statistics and learning new statistical methods.
4. My role in data science: For this goal I wanted to reflect on my role in data science and how it aligns with my academic interests.

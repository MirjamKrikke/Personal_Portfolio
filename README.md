# Time Management
## Background
For me one of the main challenges in group projects is effective time management. When thinking about what you want to do for a group project you can have a lot of ideas on what to do in a limited amount of time. You then need to decide on what the focus of the project should be on. In our group project we decided to focus on wind energy production in the Netherlands. The idea was to not only calculate and compare wind energy production for two different models (Harmonie and measurements), but to also develop a machine learning model to predict the optimal locations for wind energy development. From the start we already thought it might be a bit challenging to also develop the machine learning part in the time we had. The challenge for this learning goal was mainly to make a feasible planning that we could fall back on during the project.
## How did I work on the goal?
At the start of the project I made a planning in which I tried to include the different tasks and phases of the project. For our group this was the basis that we used to check if we were still on track. During the weeks we also decided on deliverables and added those to the planning. This was very helpful for me, because it could be a bit chaotic when everyone was working on their own things without communicating what we needed from each other. During the project I also discovered that you can make a planning but you also have to be adaptable when things don't go according to plan. I think this is very frustrating and can be time consuming. 
## Reflection on the learning goal
I still think it's very difficult to make a planning at the start of the project. You don't know which difficulties you will encouter on the way so it's difficult to decide how much time a certain task will take. As this was my first real data science project I did learn that data wrangling takes up a lot of time. At the start of the project we quickly found the data that we would use. At that point I thought we only had to do a little bit of wrangling to start the analysis and do the machine learning. But it turned out that wrangling took up most of my time. This is mainly because at the start of week 2, I made a mistake which resulted in an incorrect dataset from which we did the analysis. I only found this mistake at the start of week 3, so then I had to get back to the start to do this over. Because of the experiences in this course I do think that I now have a better idea on what is feasible in a short amount of time and how much time different tasks take.

# Time Management
## Background
For me one of the main challenges in group projects is effective time management. When thinking about what you want to do for a group project you can have a lot of ideas on what to do in a limited amount of time. You then need to decide on what the focus of the project should be on. In our group project we decided to focus on wind energy production in the Netherlands. The idea was to not only calculate and compare wind energy production for two different models (Harmonie and measurements), but to also develop a machine learning model to predict the optimal locations for wind energy development. From the start we already thought it might be a bit challenging to also develop the machine learning part in the time we had. The challenge for this learning goal was mainly to make a feasible planning that we could fall back on during the project.

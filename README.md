# Background
For this learning goal I initially wanted to make a heatmap of wind energy production for the group project. Because I spend most of my time on preprocessing data, I did not manage to make a nice map for our group project. Therefore I decided to focus a bit more on visualization of the endangered species dataset that I also used for the statistics learning goal. I still liked the idea of a heatmap and I also thought it would be a nice way of displaying species occurrences and hotspots. Therefore I took this idea as a starting point to make some visualizations using folium. I first checked out a heatmap, but for this data there were no real hotspots visible. Especially when zooming into the map the occurrences were all pretty uniform. So I brainstormed on some other ideas to display my data. I decided on making a clustered marker map with the combined species and neighborhood data that I also used for the statistics part. 
# Methodology and Data
To make the folium map I saved my combined species and neighborhood dataset as a geojson. This geojson can also be found in this branch: Species_Neighborhood_Data.geojson. I loaded this into my python script and from the geometry I calculated centroid points for each polygon. These centroids are used as the locations for my markers. I then derived the longitude and latitude of the centroids and used these to initialize my folium map. I then wrote a function to display the markers in different colours for different species counts. After that I added the markers to the map and included the count of all the categories as well as the neighborhood data. At the end of the script I also added some cartographic elements: a legend and scalebar (I also tried to include a north arrow but could not get it right). I then save and display the folium map.
# Results
The resulting folium map (html) can be found in this branch: species_clustered_markers.html.
It also shows when you run the code and then open the saved file. 
# Discussion
I think I managed to make a nice interactive visualization in folium, albeit not a heatmap. I really liked working on this learning goal in the end as I think data visualization is really cool!

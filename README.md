# My Role In Data Science
## Background
As this was my first data science course, I thought it would be nice to use this as an opportunity to think about where I see myself in data science. This could help me in deciding about courses or thesis ideas as well as my future career. 
## Methodology
To bring together my ideas on this topic I started by just brainstorming, I then gathered and visualized these ideas into a poster. 
## Results
The resulting poster can be found in this branch: my_role_in_data_science_poster.jpg
## Reflection on the learning goal
I found thinking about this question quite valuable. It doesn't necessarily show in the poster itself, which is just a gathering of some key words. This process has helped me to define my areas of interest a bit better. 
Some of my research interests are:
- Biodiversity mapping: I really liked working on this topic for the statistics and visualization part. I think it could be really interesting to combine biodiversity data with other data sources (such as land use, population, etc) to visualize their effects on biodiversity.
- Working with satellite data: During the remote sensing course I discovered the potentials of working with satellite data. This is something in which I want to develop myself further. Especially the applications that focus on water, forestry and nature 
- Spatial statistics: This is not necessarily a topic that I really like, but it is essential in researching spatial relations. So this is still something that I want to learn more of.

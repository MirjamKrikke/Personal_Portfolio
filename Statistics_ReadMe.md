# Background
During the group project I did not manage to do a lot of statistics. Therefore, I decided to do some data statistics on a new project after the group project was finished. I wanted to do a project with some biodiversity data. For this I found a dataset with endangered fauna species in the province of Utrecht. I wanted to look into the relationship between occurrences of endangered species and population density.
